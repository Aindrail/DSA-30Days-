//qlink :- https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths/
// TC :- O(m-1) or O(n-1) 
// Intuition: If we observe examples there is a similarity in paths from start to end. Each time we are taking an exactly m+n-2 number of steps to reach the end.
// From start to reach the end we need a certain number of rightward directions and a certain number of downward directions. So we can figure out we need n-1 no. of rightward direction and m-1 no. of downward direction to reach the endpoint.

// Since we need an m+n-2 number of steps to reach the end among those steps if we choose n-1 rightward direction or m-1 downward direction and calculate the combinations ( ie: m+n-2Cn-1 or m+n-2Cm-1) weâ€™ll get the total number of paths.
